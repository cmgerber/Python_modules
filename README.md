Python_modules
==============

Custom modules for python I have created.

**Current List**

* easyPickle
	+ simplified version of saving objects to .pkl
* flattenList
	+ used to flatten lists of lists to a single list
* pdSaveExcel
	+ easy function for saving multiple pandas dataframes to a single excel workbook, each dataframe as a separate sheet
	+ currently drops all non-ascii characters so writing to excel works
